# Shopping Cart Project

A simple e-commerce product grid with a shopping cart and order modal. Originally built a while ago, I recently refactored it to improve performance, readability, and UX.

## Features
- Dynamic product grid from JSON data
- Add/remove products and adjust quantity in the cart
- Order summary modal with total price
- Skeleton loader while products load
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Improved performance and cleaner code after refactor

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- Local JSON for product data

## Recent Improvements
- Refactored cart logic for readability and maintainability
- Used Maps for faster product lookups
- Event delegation to prevent duplicate listeners
- Cleaned up add-to-cart button logic and skeleton loader

## Challenge Info
This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d).
